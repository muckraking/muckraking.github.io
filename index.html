          <p>For decades, the prices of certain types of foods and crops have steadily increased, but we cannot attribute this problem solely on inflation. As we narrow down this issue to just California, it is evident that environmental changes such as the drought, climate change, and global warming have caused the increase in food prices. As the climate no longer aligns with the the requirements to grow certain kinds of crops, the ability for farms to produce specific types of food becomes increasingly more difficult.</p>
          <p>Climate change and global warming has affected a variety of different kinds of foods, and some are even considered endangered or becoming extinct. Foods such as, strawberries, almonds, apples, avocado, cherries, coffee, chocolate, bananas, fish, and honey, all fall under the list of foods that are considered endangered throughout the world. According to an article by Organic Charity, around 98% of vegetable varieties have already disappeared over the past century. Even the coffee that seems so common in our everyday lives could become extinct. One article explains that out of the 124 types of coffee discovered, we only drink 2 types: Arabica and Robusta. However, as global warming and climate change continue to alter the condition of our atmosphere, producing coffee becomes more and more difficult. According to one research, the change in temperature conditions cause numerous locations where Arabica coffee is grown, to shut down, resulting in the decrease in Arabica coffee up to 99.7%. Global warming and climate change are causing creating a lot of negative environmental change. This means that different crops must keep up with the constant fluctuation of the weather or it is no longer to grow and produce.</p>
          <p>Aside from foods that are being affected from other places around the world, Californiaâ€™s drought has also impacted the production of many types of vegetations. Since California is the main producer for grapes, strawberries, avocados, almonds, lettuce, and tomatoes, the amount of these crops have all taken a hit during the drought. Due to the lack of water, crops such as avocados have begun to skyrocket in their prices. According to an article by Spoon University, avocados used to cost 72/acre to produce, but they now cost around 2600/per acre foot, which is nearly 36 times as much as it used to cost. With this problem getting worse over the past years, it is important to understand the impact it makes in our community, as well as how we can do our part to contribute.</p>
