          <p>While you may not think about it, small increases in food prices actually have a large effect on the people.</p>
          <p>One problem is how much produce a farm will produce. With the cost of growing a crop getting more and more expensive, farms are less likely to grow those crops as much and will turn to other, cheaper crops to grow. For example, if it costs a farmer $2 to grow an avocado, but he can only sell it for $3, it is not a great food to grow in terms of profit. However, if a farmer can grow corn for less than a dollar, but still sell it for over 3, it becomes a better crop to grow should they want to maximize their profits. This contributes to the problem as then less and less farms are growing certain crops and thus the cost of those crops is raised even further.</p>
          <p>Arguably one of the biggest problems that this increase in price causes is accessibility. While many of us take fruits and vegetables as a granted when we go to the store, for many people, it’s not. Low income families struggle to pay for everything that one might say that they need to live, so often they will cut out non essential items in order to pay for more expensive things such as rent. One of the things that people often cut is food. While now many people know the health risks associated with eating at McDonalds, that still does not stop people. For those looking for a quick cheap fix, it’s one of the best options in terms of price. This is one of the biggest factors in the obesity epidemic in America. Without access to healthy foods, a lower income family may struggle to feed their children properly, putting them a high risk for a multitude of diseases when they grow up. Getting fresh produce at the store should not be something that is a privilege. </p>
          <p>While there are more problems, the two biggest ones caused by the increase of food prices in California are availability, and accessibility.</p>
