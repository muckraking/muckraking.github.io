            <h1>Jean Mordo</h1>
            <p>Former Mayor of Los Altos</p>
          </header>
          <p>
            Q: Do you believe that the price of food in Los Altos has increased over time?<br/>
            A: Yes, but thankfully not as much as real estate! <br/>
            Q: What ways has the government of California or Los Altos attempted to keep the prices of crops low?<br/>
            A: City government has no way to affect food prices. State may have limited means to do so, for example by making more water available at lower prices to farmers.<br/>
            Q: What do you think is the main cause of increasing food prices?<br/>
            A: Just general inflation.<br/>
            Q: Do you think that the drought has affected food prices?<br/>
            A: Yes, of some foods.<br/>
            Q: What do you think can be done to reduce the price of food?<br/>
            A: Allow more South American farm workers to work here.<br/>
            Q: Do you personally believe that the increasing food prices in California are a problem? Why or why not?<br/>
            A: It is a problem, but pales in comparison with rent.<br/>
            Q: Who has been affected the most by the increasing food prices?<br/>
            A: As usual, poorer people are the most affected.<br/>

            <h1>Greg Stoehr</h1>
            <p>LAHS AP Environmental Science Teacher</p>
          </header>
          <p>
            Q: How have you noticed the problem of food prices increasing in California?<br/>
            A: I don't pay close attention because fresh produce is worth it<br/>
            Q: What do you think is the cause of the problem?<br/>
            A: Inflation, cost of resources like water, land cause foods like avocados to become more expensive.<br/>
            Q: Do you think the drought is a factor of the problem?<br/>
            A: Yes, the drought is one of the main reasons why certain foods are becoming more expensive. The lack of water makes it harder for specific types of foods to become more difficult to grow.<br/>
            Q: How big of a problem do you think this increase in food prices is?<br/>
            A: It is a pretty big problem because healthy food should be affordable to everyone.<br/>
            Q: What is the government doing to help solve this problem?<br/>
            A: They are subsidizing crops and allocating water.<br/>
            Q: What do you think about farms hiring illegal immigrants to work?<br/>
            A: It is good because it provides jobs. There are laws, but I'm not against farms hiring the immigrants<br/>

            <p>Local Restaurant Owner</p>
          </header>
          <p>
            Q: Based on your experience working in the food industry, how has the increase in food prices affect you at all?<br/>
            A: The increase in food prices obviously has a huge impact on our bottom line. Rising prices is a direct correlation of less profit.<br/>
            Q: What do you think is the main cause of these increases in the price of crops?<br/>
            A: Weather<br/>
            Q: Do you think the drought has had any effects on this? How so?<br/>
            A: No, most of the vegetables we get in California are not from California<br/>
            Q: What do you think can be done to reduce the price of crops?<br/>
            A: Buy from different countries so America can shop around instead of the few we buy from now.  They control the market and the prices.<br/>
            Q: In what ways do you see the government attempting to help farmers and keep the cost of fresh produce down?<br/>
            A: The government already subsidizes farmers in this country I don’t think they can do much more.<br/>
            Q: Do you even think the increasing food prices in California are a problem? Why or why not?<br/>
            A: Of course it’s a big problem especially for people who are on a tight budget and restaurants who are struggling just to survive.<br/>
            Q: Who do you believe has been affected most by this change?<br/>
            A:People who are on a budget<br/>
            Q: What is your opinion on farms hiring undocumented immigrants to work on farms?<br/>
            A: I really don’t have an opinion on this issue.<br/>
